# Claude Computer Use Integration Test Results

## Test Summary

We've successfully integrated Claude's Computer Use capabilities with the AutoSpectra MCP server. The integration provides access to Claude's abilities to use a computer, interact with text editors, and execute bash commands through a standardized API.

## Critical Limitation: Virtual Environment

**IMPORTANT**: Claude's Computer Use operates in a sandboxed virtual environment provided by Anthropic, NOT on your local machine.

- You will NOT see a browser opening on your actual computer
- Screenshots are taken in Claude's virtual environment and are not saved to your machine
- File operations happen in Claude's virtual filesystem, not your real one
- The test scripts only show Claude's text responses and tool use actions

This is fundamentally different from AutoSpectra's browser_action tool, which controls a browser on your local machine.

## Implementation Details

- **API Provider**: Implemented in `src/computerUse/providers/api.ts`
- **Tool Versions**: Support for both Claude 3.5 Sonnet (20241022) and Claude 3.7 Sonnet (20250124)
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and logging
- **Thinking Integration**: Added support for Claude 3.7's thinking capabilities

## Testing Results

We conducted testing with both standalone tests and through the MCP server:

### Direct API Testing (`test-claude-integration.js`)

- **Tool Compatibility**: Updated tool definitions according to Anthropic's specifications
- **Tool Versioning**: Fixed critical issue where all tools for Claude 3.7 must use 20250124 version
- **Parameter Requirements**: Fixed max_tokens setting to exceed thinking.budget_tokens

### Web Browser Testing (`test-browser-navigation.js`)

- **Virtual Browser**: Successfully tested Claude's ability to navigate in its virtual browser
- **Tool Use Sequence**: Verified proper tool use sequence (screenshot → find browser → navigate → screenshot)
- **Response Structure**: Confirmed proper response handling with text, tool use, and thinking

### MCP Server Testing

Successfully integrated:
- `initialize_computer` tool - Works as expected for API-based provider
- `use_computer` tool - Properly handles complex tasks like browser navigation

## Access Requirements

Using Claude's Computer Use capabilities requires:

1. An API key with access to Claude models that support Computer Use
2. Access to the Claude Computer Use beta program
3. Using models and tool versions that are compatible:
   - Claude 3.7 Sonnet requires 20250124 tool versions for ALL tools
   - Claude 3.5 Sonnet requires 20241022 tool versions for ALL tools

## Error Handling Improvements

We've enhanced error handling in several ways:

1. **Model Compatibility**: Automatic tool version selection based on model
2. **Parameter Validation**: Max tokens adjustment for thinking capabilities
3. **Detailed Error Reporting**: Specific error messages for troubleshooting

## Integration Example

```javascript
// Initialize computer capabilities
await use_mcp_tool({
  server_name: "autospectra",
  tool_name: "initialize_computer",
  arguments: {
    type: "api",
    apiKey: "your-anthropic-api-key"
  }
});

// Use computer capabilities
await use_mcp_tool({
  server_name: "autospectra",
  tool_name: "use_computer",
  arguments: {
    prompt: "Create a text file named test.txt",
    model: "claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219" // Optional, overrides default
  }
});
```

## Limitations

Current limitations of the integration:

1. API key must have access to Claude models with Computer Use capabilities
2. Model and tool version compatibility must be maintained
3. For Claude 3.7, max_tokens must exceed thinking.budget_tokens
4. **Cannot directly observe** Claude's virtual environment activities
5. Cannot save screenshots or files from Claude's virtual environment to your machine

## Next Steps

Future improvements could include:

1. Add support for container-based environments
2. Improve visualization of Computer Use activities
3. Save screenshots from virtual environment to local disk
4. Enhanced error reporting and recovery mechanisms
